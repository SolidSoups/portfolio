# SUSHI 2 GO!

## Quick facts and credits

## WHAT IS THE GAME?
**Sushi 2 Go!** is a endless runner where you play as a Sushi that tries to
escape a bustling restaurant. While jumping on the conveyor belt; plates, dishes
and bottles will block your path. If isn't bad enough, the customers will remove
and put down plates at their whim to spice up the playstyle.

## MY JOURNEY THROUGH THE PROJECT
With more previous experience than my peers, I lead the
programming team. I also had a weight on the design of the game, mechanics and
styling.

## Future games awards
2nd place for animation and 2nd place for art
