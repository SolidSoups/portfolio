**Sushi 2 Go!** is an endless runner taking place entirely on a sushi restaurant conveyor belt. 
Playing as a sushi motivated on escaping, you need to evade and jump over plates, dishes and bottles coming torwards you. If that was'nt hard enough, customers will at their own whim put down and grab plates.

### Contributions

As the programming lead, I managed tasks, as well as providing mentorship to the junior team members. Being limited in both programming and design resources, I took ownership of the design direction and implementation planning.
